# MTE-Traineeship-Project-Age-at-Death-Analysis-for-Left-Handed-and-Right-Handed-Individuals-
Explore the intriguing relationship between handedness and age at death through a comprehensive analysis. This repository contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and data files used to investigate and visualize patterns in left-handed and right-handed individuals' ages at the time of death. The analysis includes data preprocessing, statistical computations, and insightful visualizations, providing a nuanced understanding of how handedness may correlate with longevity.

Key Features:

Utilization of death distribution data and handedness probabilities
Calculation of left-handed and right-handed probabilities for various ages
Visualization of probability distributions and trends over age
Computation of mean ages at death for left-handers and right-handers
Clear and concise code with detailed comments for easy understanding
